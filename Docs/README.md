# NOTE
The [document](https://github.com/hemantjunejaRD/UART/blob/main/Docs/sprugp1.pdf) above contains UART architecture given by Texas instruments, which consists of programmable buad rate and works on 16X and 13X oversampling mode. 
I have taken it as reference to Design a UART, with fixed baud rates of 9600 and 19200 working on a fixed clock rate of 100Mhz .

### Here we will also discuss about different registers which are used in this architecture in detail.
